# Introduction

The purpose of this case study is to address the real-world problem of calculating the distance between two geographic locations and visually displaying them on a map. The code provided uses the geopy library for calculating distances and obtaining the country names, and the folium library for creating an interactive map.

# Problems

- Users need to input the latitude and longitude of two positions, but they may input incorrect values or values outside the acceptable range.
- The distance between the two positions must be calculated and presented to the user in a comprehensible manner.
- The country names corresponding to the positions need to be determined.
- A visual representation of the positions and their distance is required.

# Solutions

- The code uses a while loop and input validation to ensure that the user inputs latitude and longitude values within the acceptable ranges.
- The geopy library's distance function is utilized to calculate the distance between the two positions in kilometers.
- The geopy library's Nominatim geolocator is employed to obtain the country names for the given positions.
- The folium library is used to create an interactive map displaying the two positions as markers with distinct colors and a line between them, representing the distance.

# Conclusion

The code effectively addresses the problem by obtaining user input for the latitude and longitude of two positions, calculating the distance between them, identifying the corresponding countries, and visually displaying the positions and their distance on an interactive map. This solution demonstrates the practical application of the geopy and folium libraries in solving real-world geographic problems.

# Next steps

- Implement error handling for cases where the geolocation services are unable to determine the country name.
- Enhance the user experience by allowing users to input location names or addresses instead of latitude and longitude values.
- Extend the functionality to support multiple positions and calculate the total distance of a route between them.
- Evaluate the possibility of integrating other map visualization libraries to provide additional features or improve the visual representation.
