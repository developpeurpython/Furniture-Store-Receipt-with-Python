# Introduction

The dataset used for this case study was obtained from a 000webhost leak and contains around 0.7 million passwords that were consistently classified as weak, medium, or strong by three commercial password strength meters (Twitter, Microsoft, and Battle). The dataset is available on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-dataset. The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine learning-based approach in classifying password strength, as opposed to relying on rule-based commercial algorithms.

# Problems

The major problem in this scenario is to accurately classify password strength, taking into account the complexities and variations of real-world passwords. To analyze the problem, I explored the given dataset, cleaned it by removing duplicates and missing values, and used the consistent classification provided by the three commercial algorithms as a basis for training a machine learning model.

# Solutions

The primary solution I proposed is to use a RandomForestClassifier model to classify password strength based on a matrix of TF-IDF features. This approach is different from commercial algorithms as it is entirely based on machine learning, allowing the model to adapt and improve its performance with more data. I also considered other machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks, as potential alternatives.

**Pros and cons of each solution:**

- RandomForestClassifier:

  - Pros: Easy to implement, good performance, less prone to overfitting.
  - Cons: Can be slow to train on large datasets, less interpretable than rule-based methods.
  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM):

  - Pros: Effective for high-dimensional datasets, can handle non-linear relationships.
  - Cons: Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, slow to train on large datasets.
  
- Neural Networks:

  - Pros: Can model complex relationships, highly flexible and scalable.
  - Cons: Requires more data, harder to interpret, more computational resources needed.
  
# Conclusion

Throughout the case study, I cleaned and analyzed a dataset of 0.7 million passwords, applied feature extraction techniques, and trained a RandomForestClassifier model to classify password strength. The machine learning-based approach proved to be effective and demonstrated the potential to outperform rule-based commercial algorithms in classifying password strength.

# Next Steps

Based on the analysis and comparison of different machine learning models, I recommend proceeding with the RandomForestClassifier model for password strength classification. The model offers a good balance between ease of implementation, performance, and generalization. To implement this solution, the client should:

- Train the RandomForestClassifier model on the cleaned dataset using the provided code.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a test set to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
- Integrate the trained model into their existing systems for password strength classification, replacing rule-based algorithms.
- Continuously monitor and update the model with new data to ensure its performance remains optimal.

The client's technical team should be responsible for implementing and maintaining the model, while the management should oversee the integration and monitor the model's impact on password security.
