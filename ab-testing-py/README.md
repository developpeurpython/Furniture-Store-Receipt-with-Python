# Introduction

In this case study, I aim to analyze the performance of two advertising campaigns, the control and test campaigns, using data collected from an A/B test. The datasets control_group.csv and test_group.csv are based on A/B testing data submitted by İlker Yıldız on Kaggle, which can also be found at https://statso.io/a-b-testing-case-study/. The goal is to determine which campaign is more effective and to understand the relationships between different metrics. I assume that the data provided is accurate and complete, except for the missing values, which I will fill in during the analysis. I will present various visualizations to illustrate the findings and make the presentation more engaging.

# Problems

The main problems I need to address in this case study are:

- Identifying any missing values in the data and filling them in appropriately.
- Comparing the performance of the control and test campaigns using various metrics.
- Analyzing the relationships between different metrics in the dataset.

# Solutions

- Fill missing values using the mean of the respective column. This technique involves calculating the mean (average) of the available data points in a specific column and then replacing any missing values in that column with the calculated mean. This approach helps maintain the overall distribution and central tendency of the data in the column.
- Create visualizations to compare the performance of the two campaigns:

- Analyze the visualizations to identify any patterns or correlations in the data:

# Pros

- Visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of the data.
- Filling in missing values with the mean retains the overall distribution of the data.

# Cons

- Mean imputation may not always be the best method for filling in missing values.
- Correlations observed in the data may not always imply causation.

# Conclusion

Through this case study, I have analyzed the performance of two advertising campaigns using data visualization techniques. The relationships between different metrics were examined, and the effectiveness of each campaign was compared. Valuable insights were gained from the visualizations, which can be used to improve the advertising strategy.

# Next steps

Based on my findings, the recommended solution is to focus on the campaign that performed better in terms of the metrics analyzed. Specific actions I propose include:

- Review the successful campaign's strategy and identify the elements that contributed to its performance.
- Apply these successful elements to the other campaign, or create a new campaign combining the best practices.
- Continuously monitor the performance of the campaigns and make necessary adjustments based on the insights obtained from the data.

The benefits of this solution include improved advertising effectiveness, better resource allocation, and increased return on investment.
