# Introduction

The purpose of this case study is to analyze the demand and supply patterns of cab ride services, which is critical for businesses like Ola and Uber to optimize their operations, maximize profits, and make informed decisions. I found the dataset for this case study at https://statso.io/demand-and-supply-case-study/. Cab services have become an essential part of urban transportation, with people relying heavily on these services for their daily commutes. Understanding the demand and supply patterns can help optimize their operations and provide a better user experience to customers.

# Problems

The major problem is to understand the relationship between the demand for rides and the supply of drivers in a particular city. To analyze this problem, I used a dataset that contains the following features:

- Drivers Active Per Hour: Number of drivers active per hour.
- Riders Active Per Hour: Number of Riders looking for rides.
- Rides Completed: Number of rides completed.

# Solutions

To analyze the demand and supply patterns, I conducted a data analysis using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly libraries. I started by cleaning the dataset, removing any missing values, and calculating additional metrics like the supply ratio (rides completed per driver active per hour) and the elasticity of demand.

I created two visualizations to understand the patterns:

- **A scatter plot of demand vs. supply with an OLS regression line:** This plot shows the relationship between the number of drivers active per hour (supply) and the number of riders active per hour (demand). The OLS regression line helps identify the trend, and the slope of this line, called elasticity, indicates how sensitive the demand is to changes in supply. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression is a statistical method used to estimate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables by finding the best-fitting linear model that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the actual data points and the predicted values.

- **A plot of supply ratio vs. driver activity:** This plot shows the relationship between driver activity (drivers active per hour) and the supply ratio (rides completed per driver active per hour). It helps identify whether increasing driver activity leads to a more efficient utilization of resources.

# Conclusion

Through the analysis and visualizations, I learned about the demand and supply patterns for cab ride services in the city. The elasticity of demand, estimated using OLS regression, provides insights into how sensitive the demand for rides is to changes in the supply of drivers. The supply ratio helps identify the efficiency of driver activity.

# Next Steps

Based on the analysis, the following optimized steps are recommended to improve the balance between demand and supply for the cab ride services:

- **Implement dynamic driver incentives:** To encourage drivers to be more active during peak hours, the cab service company should introduce a dynamic incentive system. This system should adjust the incentives based on real-time demand and supply data, ensuring that more drivers are available when demand is high. The incentives could include bonuses, surge pricing, or other perks.
- **Develop an intelligent driver dispatch system:** The company should invest in developing an intelligent driver dispatch system that optimizes driver allocation based on factors such as location, time, and demand. This will help in ensuring that drivers are directed towards areas with higher demand, reducing waiting times for riders and improving overall efficiency.
- **Continuously monitor and analyze data:** It is crucial to continuously monitor and analyze the data to assess the effectiveness of these strategies. The company should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of these initiatives, such as average waiting time for riders, average earnings per driver, and overall utilization of resources.
- **Encourage rider feedback and iterate:** Gathering feedback from riders is essential to understanding their needs and preferences. The company should actively seek rider feedback and use this information to fine-tune the strategies and improve the overall user experience.
- **Periodically reevaluate and adjust strategies:** As the market dynamics and user preferences change over time, it is crucial to periodically reevaluate and adjust the strategies to ensure they remain effective. Regular data analysis and feedback from both riders and drivers will help in identifying new trends and making informed decisions.

By implementing these optimized steps, the cab service company can improve the balance between demand and supply, leading to a better user experience for riders and more efficient utilization of resources for drivers.
