# Introduction

In this case study, I aim to address the real-world problem of password security using a machine learning model based on the password_strength_classifier (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-dataset). The scenario involves a dataset of passwords, sourced from the 000webhost leak, with varying strengths as determined by three commercial password strength meters (Twitter, Microsoft, and Battle). The goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict the strength of a given password. To achieve this, I will make use of Python and relevant libraries.

# Problems

The major problems I will encounter in this case study are:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the raw dataset, which may contain duplicate or missing values.
- Converting password data into meaningful features that can be used for machine learning.
- Selecting an appropriate machine learning model for the classification task.
- Evaluating the performance of the trained model to ensure its reliability.

# Solutions

To address the problems mentioned above, I will follow these steps:

- Clean the raw dataset by removing duplicates and missing values, and convert the numeric strength values into corresponding labels ("weak", "medium", "strong").
- Use the TfidfVectorizer to transform the passwords into feature vectors based on character n-grams.
- Train a RandomForestClassifier as the machine learning model, which is known for its robustness and ability to handle a wide range of data.
- Evaluate the model performance using accuracy_score on a test dataset that was not used during training.

# Conclusion

Throughout this case study, I have demonstrated the process of preparing data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance in the context of password strength classification using the password_strength_classifier. By leveraging a dataset with consistent strength labels determined by multiple commercial password strength meters, I have developed a machine learning-based solution that is not reliant on predefined rules. I have learned the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in creating an effective solution.

The code execution resulted in the following output:

```plaintext
  Accuracy: 0.9272892897676364
  Predictions: ['weak' 'medium' 'strong' 'strong']
```

Output explanation:

- Accuracy: The trained RandomForestClassifier model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92.73% on the test dataset. This indicates that the model was able to correctly predict the strength of passwords in the test set 92.73% of the time.
- Predictions: The model was then used to predict the strength of four sample passwords: "123456", "password", "p@ssw0rd", and "myverystrongpassword123!". The model classified these passwords as 'weak', 'medium', 'strong', and 'strong', respectively. This output shows that the model is capable of providing meaningful predictions for password strength, which can be utilized in real-world applications.

# Next steps

Based on the results of this case study, I recommend the following actions:

- Deploy the trained RandomForestClassifier model as a password strength evaluation tool in web applications or other systems that require password security.
- Continuously update the model with new password data to improve its predictive capabilities.
- Consider experimenting with other machine learning models or feature engineering techniques to potentially improve the model's performance.
- Implement user education programs to encourage the use of strong, unique passwords, which can further enhance overall security.

By taking these steps, the benefits of the recommended solution can be realized, ultimately leading to improved password security and a reduced risk of unauthorized access.
