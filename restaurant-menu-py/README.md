# Introduction

My case study is about a restaurant business facing revenue loss due to poor organization of its sales data. This is a common obstacle faced by many businesses that do not have a centralized sales database to track sales and inventory. My goal is to help the restaurant business identify the major problems and provide solutions to help alleviate these issues.

# Problem

My analysis of the sales data shows that the restaurant is losing revenue due to poor organization and tracking of sales data. Specifically, the restaurant is losing money due to inconsistent pricing and inventory management, as well as inefficiencies in the ordering process. I have identified that the most popular menu items are pancakes, waffles, burger, home fries, and coffee. However, inconsistent pricing has led to some items being sold at a loss, resulting in lower revenue. Additionally, inventory management issues have led to some menu items being out of stock, causing potential revenue loss.

# Solutions

To help alleviate these issues, I recommend implementing a centralized sales database to track sales and inventory. This database can help ensure consistent pricing, better inventory management, and a more efficient ordering process. By doing so, the restaurant can increase revenue and reduce potential revenue loss due to inventory mismanagement. Alternative solutions to consider include hiring additional staff to help manage the sales data or outsourcing the sales data management to a third-party company. However, these alternatives may be less cost-effective than implementing a centralized sales database.

To better illustrate the revenue generated by each franchise and menu item, I have created several data visualizations. These visualizations show that inconsistent pricing and inventory management issues are causing the restaurant to lose revenue. Additionally, the visualizations show that implementing a centralized sales database can potentially increase revenue by improving inventory management and reducing potential revenue loss.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, by implementing a centralized sales database, the restaurant can better manage its sales data, resulting in increased revenue and reduced potential revenue loss. My analysis and data visualizations demonstrate that this solution is the most cost-effective and efficient way to address the issues the restaurant is facing.

# Next Steps

I recommend that the restaurant implement a centralized sales database as soon as possible. The database should be managed by a dedicated staff member and integrated into the ordering process. Additionally, I recommend conducting regular audits of the database to ensure consistent pricing and proper inventory management. By doing so, the restaurant can maximize revenue and reduce potential revenue loss.
