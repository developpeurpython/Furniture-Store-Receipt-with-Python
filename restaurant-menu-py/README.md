# Code explanation

Here's an explanation of each class and its methods:

**The Menu class**:

- __init__(self, name, items, start_time, end_time): This method initializes the Menu object with the name of the menu, the available items and their prices in the form of a dictionary, and the start and end times of the menu.
- __repr__(self): This method returns a string representation of the Menu object in the format "name menu available from start_time to end_time".
- calculate_bill(self, purchased_items): This method takes a list of purchased items and returns the total bill by iterating over the purchased items, counting the number of each item, and adding up their prices.
- add_item(self, name, price): This method adds a new item to the menu's item dictionary.

**The Franchise class**:

- __init__(self, address, menus): This method initializes the Franchise object with the franchise address and a list of available menus.
- __repr__(self): This method returns a string representation of the Franchise object in the format "Franchise at address".
- available_menus(self, time): This method takes a time and returns a list of menus that are available at that time by iterating over the menus and checking if they are available at the given time.
- add_menu(self, menu): This method adds a new menu to the franchise's menus list.
- remove_menu(self, menu): This method removes a menu from the franchise's menus list.

**The Business class**:

- __init__(self, name, franchises): This method initializes the Business object with the name of the business and a list of Franchise objects.
- __repr__(self): This method returns a string representation of the Business object in the format "name Business".
- total_revenue(self): This method calculates the total revenue for the business by iterating over the franchises, menus, and items to add up their prices.

**The testing code creates Menu, Franchise, and Business objects and tests the functionality of the classes by calling the methods. Specifically, the code**:

- Defines dictionaries of menu items for different menus.
- Creates Menu objects for each menu type and adds them to a list of all menus.
- Creates a new Menu object for a new menu type.
- Creates Franchise objects for different restaurant locations, passing in the address and a list of available menus.
- Creates Business objects for different restaurant brands, passing in the name and a list of Franchise objects.
- Tests the functionality of the classes by calling methods like calculate_bill, available_menus, add_item, add_menu, remove_menu, and total_revenue.

# Required skills

To create this project, one needs the following Python skills:

- Object-oriented programming: defining and instantiating classes, using methods, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Python syntax and data types: familiarity with built-in functions, lists, dictionaries, strings, and integers, and slicing and indexing data structures.
- Control flow statements: working with if, for, and while loops, and Boolean expressions.
- Input/output operations: writing to files, printing to the console, and string formatting.
- Data structures: creating and managing complex data structures and iterating through them.
- Software testing: writing test cases and debugging code, and using Python's built-in testing frameworks.
- Software engineering: code organization, modularity, and documentation, and code version control using Git and GitHub.
