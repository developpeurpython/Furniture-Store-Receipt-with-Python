# Introduction

In this case study, I will analyze a dataset related to supply chain management. The dataset was found at https://statso.io/supply-chain-analysis-case-study/. The purpose of this case study is to identify potential problems in the supply chain, propose solutions, and provide insights that can help improve efficiency and performance. This dataset is a representation of a real-world scenario where a company needs to analyze and optimize its supply chain to increase revenues and minimize costs.

# Problems

Upon exploring the dataset, I identified several problems that need to be addressed in the supply chain:

- **Relationship between price and revenue**: Understanding the correlation between product price and the generated revenue is essential for pricing strategies.
- **Sales distribution by product type**: Identifying the most and least sold products can help make informed decisions about inventory management and marketing strategies.
- **Total revenue by shipping carrier**: Analyzing the performance of different shipping carriers can help optimize logistics and reduce costs.
- **SKU analysis**: Analyzing the revenue generated, stock levels, and order quantities by SKU can provide insights into product performance and inventory management.
- **Cost distribution by transportation mode**: Understanding the cost distribution across different transportation modes can help optimize logistics and transportation costs.
- **Defect rates by product type and transportation mode**: High defect rates can lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased costs. Identifying the root cause of these defects is essential for improving product quality and reducing costs.
- **Shipping costs by carrier**: High shipping costs can erode profit margins. Analyzing shipping costs by carrier can help identify potential areas for cost optimization.

By addressing these problems through data analysis and visualizations, we can gain valuable insights to improve the supply chain's efficiency and performance.

# Solutions

To address these problems, I created various visualizations and conducted data analysis using Python and Plotly.

- **Price vs Revenue Scatter Plot**: I created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between price and revenue generated, using product type as a color factor. This visualization helps identify potential pricing strategies that can maximize revenue.

- **Sales by Product Type Pie Chart**: I created a pie chart to visualize the sales distribution by product type. This visualization helps identify the most and least sold products, providing insights for inventory management and marketing strategies.

- **Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier Bar Chart**: I created a bar chart to visualize the total revenue generated by each shipping carrier. This visualization helps identify the best-performing shipping carriers and optimize logistics.

- **SKU Analysis Line Charts and Bar Chart**: I created line charts to visualize the revenue generated and stock levels by SKU, as well as a bar chart for order quantities by SKU. These visualizations provide insights into product performance and inventory management.

- **Defect Rates Visualizations**: I calculated and visualized the average defect rates by product type and transportation mode using a bar chart and a pie chart. These visualizations help identify the root cause of high defect rates and provide insights for improving product quality and reducing costs.

# Conclusion

By analyzing the dataset and creating various visualizations, I was able to identify key problems in the supply chain and propose data-driven solutions. This case study highlights the importance of data analysis in supply chain management, providing valuable insights that can help improve efficiency, optimize costs, and increase revenues.

# Next Steps

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- Re-evaluate pricing strategies based on the relationship between price and revenue to maximize revenue.
- Focus on the most sold products for inventory management and marketing strategies, while considering discontinuing or repositioning the least sold products.
- Optimize logistics by selecting the best-performing shipping carriers to reduce costs.
- Closely monitor SKU performance and adjust inventory levels accordingly.
- Explore alternative transportation modes or negotiate better rates with current providers to optimize transportation costs.
- Investigate the root causes of high defect rates by product type and transportation mode and implement corrective measures to improve product quality and reduce costs.
- Negotiate better shipping rates with carriers or consider alternative carriers to reduce shipping costs. This can be done by leveraging the volume of business or exploring long-term partnerships with carriers.

To ensure the success of these recommendations, it is essential to establish clear objectives, allocate resources, and assign responsibilities. The implementation should be monitored closely, with regular progress reports and adjustments made as needed. By taking these steps, the company can improve its supply chain performance and create a more efficient, cost-effective, and customer-focused operation.
