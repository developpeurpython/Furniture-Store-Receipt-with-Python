# Introduction

In this case study I will be discussing the population growth of Istanbul, Turkey, over time. The purpose of this case study is to provide insights into the factors driving the city's population growth and the potential implications of this growth.

# Problems

There are three primary problems that I will be addressing in this study:

- Understanding the population growth of Istanbul over time, including the changes in population figures and annual growth rates for different periods.
- Identifying the factors that have contributed to the growth of the city's population, including demographic, economic, and social factors.
- Analyzing the implications of the population growth for the city's infrastructure, economy, and society, including the challenges and opportunities presented by this growth.

# Solutions

To tackle these problems, I utilized a variety of methods, including:

- **Data analysis**: I analyzed population data for Istanbul from different years (1927, 1950, 2000, and 2017) to calculate the change in population and annual growth rates between different periods. This allowed me to identify trends and patterns in the city's population growth over time.
- **Data visualization**: I created line and bar charts to illustrate the population growth and annual growth rates of Istanbul. This visualization has two charts:

  - The line chart shows how the population of Istanbul has changed over time, from 1927 to 2017. 
  - The bar chart shows the annual growth rates for two different time periods: 1927-2017 and 1950-2000.

- **Additional information**: I also included supplementary information about Istanbul, such as its status as the largest city in Turkey and one of the world's fastest growing metropolitan areas. This information provides context for the population growth and highlights the significance of the city's growth for the region and the world.

# Conclusion

To summarize, Istanbul has experienced significant population growth over the past century, with a particularly rapid increase in the last few decades. This growth is attributed to a combination of demographic, economic, and social factors, including urbanization, immigration, and economic development. The growth of the city's population has several implications for its infrastructure, economy, and society, and addressing these challenges will require targeted investments and policies.

# Next steps

Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that the city of Istanbul prioritize investment in infrastructure, including transportation, housing, and public services, to support the growing population. Developing policies to address social and economic issues associated with the growth, such as income inequality and unemployment, should also be a priority. Finally, continued monitoring and analysis of population trends will be necessary to inform future planning and decision-making.
