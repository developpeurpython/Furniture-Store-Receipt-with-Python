# Code explanation

This code simulates a simple furniture store that:

- sells three items, each with their respective descriptions and prices
- calculates the sales tax rate and defines a function to calculate the sales tax
- simulates a customer purchasing two items from the store
- calculates the total cost of the customer's purchases, adds the sales tax, and prints a receipt with the itemization, subtotal, sales tax, and total cost

The code is optimized for readability and efficiency by using a dictionary to store the inventory, a loop to iterate over the customer's purchases, and f-strings to format the output.
