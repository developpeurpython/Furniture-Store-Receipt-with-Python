# Introduction

In this case study, I will be analyzing the performance of two online advertising campaigns using the data from the CSV files "control_group.csv" and "test_group.csv". The purpose of this analysis is to determine which campaign is more effective. This scenario is relevant in the real world, as businesses constantly seek to optimize their marketing efforts by comparing different strategies. For the purpose of this case study, I will assume that the data provided is accurate and representative of the campaigns' performances. My goal is to identify potential issues in the campaigns, propose solutions for improvement, and choose the best course of action for the client or business.

# Problems

Upon examining the data from the "control_group.csv" and "test_group.csv" files, I noticed that there were several missing values in key performance metrics, such as "Number of Impressions", "Reach", "Website Clicks", among others. These missing values may lead to incorrect analysis and interpretation of the campaigns' effectiveness. To address this issue, I analyzed the problem and filled in the missing values with the mean of the respective columns.

# Solutions

The primary solution I propose is to conduct an A/B test comparing the two campaigns. By analyzing the cleaned data and creating visualizations such as scatter plots and pie charts, I can directly compare the performances of the control and test groups. By analyzing the cleaned data and creating the following visualizations, I can directly compare the performances of the control and test groups:

**1. Scatter plot showing the relationship between "Number of Impressions" and "Amount Spent" by campaign:** This visualization helps us understand how the amount spent on advertising relates to the number of impressions generated by each campaign. The trendline can indicate the efficiency of each campaign in generating impressions for the given advertising budget.

**2. Pie chart comparing "Searches Received" for control and test groups:** This chart provides a visual comparison of the total number of searches received by each campaign. By comparing the proportion of searches between the control and test campaigns, we can easily identify which campaign is more effective in driving user engagement with the search feature.

**3. Pie chart comparing "Website Clicks" for control and test groups:** This chart displays the total number of website clicks for each campaign. A higher proportion of website clicks for one campaign can indicate better user engagement and interest in the advertised products or services.

**4. Pie chart comparing "Content Viewed" for control and test groups:** This chart shows the total amount of content viewed for each campaign. Comparing the proportion of content viewed between the control and test campaigns can help us understand which campaign is more effective in keeping users engaged with the content.

**5. Pie chart comparing "Added to Cart" for control and test groups:** This chart provides a visual comparison of the total number of items added to the cart for each campaign. A higher proportion of items added to the cart for one campaign can indicate better user engagement and interest in purchasing the advertised products.

**6. Pie chart comparing "Amount Spent" for control and test groups:** This chart displays the total amount spent on advertising for each campaign. Comparing the proportion of the amount spent can help us understand the resource allocation between the control and test campaigns.

**7. Pie chart comparing "Purchases" for control and test groups:** This chart shows the total number of purchases made for each campaign. A higher proportion of purchases for one campaign can indicate a more effective marketing strategy in converting users into paying customers.

**8. Scatter plot showing the relationship between "Content Views" and "Website Clicks" by campaign:** This visualization highlights the correlation between the amount of content viewed and the number of website clicks for each campaign. A stronger correlation might indicate better content engagement and an effective marketing strategy.

**9. Scatter plot showing the relationship between "Added to Cart" and "Content Views" by campaign:** This graph illustrates the connection between items added to the cart and the content viewed for each campaign. A positive relationship between these two metrics may suggest that the content is effective in driving users to add products to their carts.

**10. Scatter plot showing the relationship between "Purchases" and "Added to Cart" by campaign:** This visualization displays the association between the number of purchases and items added to the cart for each campaign. Analyzing this relationship can help us understand how well the campaigns are converting potential customers who have added items to their carts into actual buyers.

Here are a few alternative solutions to consider:

- Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the data using advanced statistical techniques, such as regression analysis or machine learning algorithms, to identify patterns and trends that might not be visible through simple visualizations.

  - Pros: This approach could reveal more nuanced insights and provide more accurate predictions of the campaigns' future performance.
  - Cons: It may require more time and expertise to implement, and the results may still be subject to interpretation and uncertainty.

- Implement a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which is a more advanced form of A/B testing that dynamically adjusts the allocation of resources between the campaigns based on their performance.

  - Pros: This could lead to more efficient allocation of resources and faster identification of the better-performing campaign.
  - Cons: It may be more complex to implement and requires continuous monitoring and updating of the algorithm.

# Conclusion

After analyzing the data from the "control_group.csv" and "test_group.csv" files and generating visualizations, I have gained a better understanding of the differences in performance between the two campaigns. The A/B testing allowed me to compare key performance metrics and identify areas where one campaign may be outperforming the other.

# Next steps

Based on my analysis, I recommend proceeding with the A/B testing solution. This approach allows for a direct comparison of the two campaigns' performance and can help the client or business make data-driven decisions. To implement this solution, the client or business should:

- Continue to monitor the performance of both campaigns, ensuring that data collection is accurate and consistent.
- Regularly update the A/B test with new data to maintain its relevance and accuracy.
- Assign a team or individual to analyze the results of the A/B test, identifying trends and areas for improvement.
- Make data-driven decisions based on the results of the A/B test, such as allocating more resources to the better-performing campaign or making adjustments to the less effective one.

By following these steps, the client or business can optimize their online advertising efforts and improve their overall marketing strategy. Remember to include the visualizations either as images or links to an interactive platform, so stakeholders can better understand the insights and findings.
