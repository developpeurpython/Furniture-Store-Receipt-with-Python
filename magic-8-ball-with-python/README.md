# Code explanation

This Python program simulates a Magic 8-Ball game, where the user can ask a question and receive a random answer. The program follows these steps:

- Define the main function with the game loop and input validation.
- Prompt the user to enter their name and question.
- Generate a random answer from a list of possible answers.
- Print the user's name and question (if provided), and the Magic 8-Ball's answer.
- Ask the user if they want to play again, and exit if the user chooses to quit.
- Handle exceptions to exit the program gracefully.

# Required skills

To create this Python project, you will need to:

- Understand basic Python programming concepts, such as conditional statements, loops, user input/output, and list manipulation.
- Be familiar with the random module in Python to generate random numbers.
- Know how to handle exceptions using try and except statements.
- Understand the importance of good coding practices, such as writing readable code and adding comments.
- Be able to design and implement an algorithm to structure the program effectively.

Overall, the project requires a combination of technical skills and problem-solving ability to create a functioning Magic 8-Ball game.
