# Introduction

This case study aims to help a furniture store increase its sales and profits by addressing the issue that only one of its three items is selling well. Our goal is to identify ways to increase the sales of the less popular items and improve the store's business performance.

# Problem

The store's sales data shows that the Lovely Loveseat is the only best-selling item, while the other two items, Stylish Settee and Luxurious Lamp, are not selling well. This could lead to a decline in sales and profits if no action is taken.

# Solutions

Two potential solutions have been identified:

- Increase the marketing efforts for the Stylish Settee and Luxurious Lamp by advertising these items more prominently in the store and online.
- Bundle the less popular items with the best-selling item, Lovely Loveseat, as a package deal to encourage customers to purchase all three items.

However, there are potential drawbacks to each solution. The first solution may not reach the target audience effectively, and the second solution may result in a decrease in profit if the bundled price is too low. Therefore, it is important for the store to experiment and measure the success of each solution to determine which one is most effective.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we recommend the store bundle the less popular items with the best-selling item, Lovely Loveseat, as a package deal and market it through various channels. The bundled price should be reasonable to prevent a loss in profit. The store should track sales before and after implementation of the solution, and regularly monitor and adjust the plan as necessary.

# Next Steps

The store manager should enforce this plan, and implement the solution within the next two weeks to capture potential customers interested in purchasing furniture.
