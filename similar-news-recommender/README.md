# Introduction

I recently came across a dataset containing news articles and their titles at https://statso.io/news-recommendation-case-study/. Intrigued by the dataset, I decided to conduct a case study on how to develop a news article recommendation system. The goal is to provide users with a list of relevant articles based on the similarity of their titles. In this case study, I will explore various text analysis techniques and algorithms to address the challenges and offer possible solutions. This real-world obstacle is important as it can help businesses or news platforms to engage users more effectively by providing tailored recommendations.

# Problems

Upon examining the dataset, I noticed that the main challenge was to find a suitable method for comparing the similarity between article titles. Moreover, preprocessing the data was necessary to handle missing values and ensure the quality of the input. For analyzing the problem, I researched text similarity techniques and chose the cosine similarity, which is a commonly used metric for comparing text documents.

# Solutions

To address the problem, I implemented the following solution:

- Preprocessed the data by removing rows with missing values.
- Used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to convert the article titles into a numerical representation.
- Calculated the cosine similarity between all pairs of article titles.
- Defined a function to recommend articles based on the given article title, using the similarity scores.

This solution has its pros and cons:

**Pros:**

- It is relatively simple and straightforward to implement.
- It takes into account the importance of words in the titles.

**Cons:**

- It might not be the most accurate method for measuring text similarity, as it only considers the frequency of words and not their order or context.
- It relies solely on the article titles and does not take into account other features such as the article content or user preferences.

# Conclusion

Throughout this case study, I have learned how to preprocess and analyze a dataset containing news articles and their titles. I have also explored the use of cosine similarity and TF-IDF for text analysis and developed a simple article recommendation system. Although the solution I implemented might not be the most accurate or comprehensive, it serves as a starting point for further development and improvements.

# Next Steps

For future improvements, I would consider the following alternatives:

- Experiment with other text similarity techniques, such as Jaccard similarity or Word2Vec, to compare their performance with the cosine similarity and choose the most suitable method.
- Extend the recommendation system by incorporating additional features, such as article content, categories, or user preferences, to provide more personalized recommendations.
- Explore the use of collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to create a more sophisticated recommendation system.

To implement these recommendations, I would start by researching and comparing various similarity metrics and algorithms. Next, I would collaborate with the client or business to obtain additional data or user feedback. Finally, I would revise and optimize the recommendation system based on the chosen algorithms and features. This would require collaboration between data scientists, developers, and stakeholders to ensure a successful implementation and positive impact on user engagement.
