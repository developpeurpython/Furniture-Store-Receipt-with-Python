- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Internet of Things
- Robotics
- and many other fields

Python-Projects is a repository that contains a collection of projects primarily made with Python. Feel free to draw inspiration from the projects and optimize the code according to your needs. Be imaginative and have fun!
