# Python-Projects

Hi, my name is Damien SOULÃ‰. I am passionate about Python programming in general. I enjoy diversifying my projects by using frameworks, packages or libraries that meet specific needs. I created Python-Projects, a repository that contains a collection of projects primarily made with Python. Feel free to draw inspiration from the projects and optimize the code according to your needs. Be imaginative and have fun!

# My Python Projects

Below is a list of my Python projects that focus on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development:
