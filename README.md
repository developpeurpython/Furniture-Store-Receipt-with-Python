# Python-Projects

Hi, my name is Damien SOULÃ‰. I am passionate about Python programming in general. I enjoy diversifying my projects by using frameworks, packages or libraries that meet specific needs. I created Python-Projects, a repository that contains a collection of projects primarily made with Python. Feel free to draw inspiration from the projects and optimize the code according to your needs. Be imaginative and have fun!

# Projects

As projects appear, they will be categorized and added to the list below :

- [Furniture Store Receipt with Python](https://github.com/developpeurpython/python-projects/tree/main/furniture-store-receipt-with-python)
