# Python-Projects

Hi, my name is Damien SOULÃ‰. I am passionate about Python programming in general. I enjoy diversifying my projects by using frameworks, packages or libraries that meet specific needs, whether it is for:

- Web development
- Game creation
- Data science
- Artificial intelligence
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Internet of Things
- and many other fields

Python-Projects is a repository created that contains a collection of projects primarily made with Python. Feel free to draw inspiration from the projects and optimize the code according to your needs. Be imaginative and have fun!
