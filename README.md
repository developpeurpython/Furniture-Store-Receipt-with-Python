# About

My name is Damien Soulé, and I was born in 1990 in La Réunion (France). I am passionate about Python programming. My projects primarily focus on data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and all related disciplines (robotics, Internet of Things, etc.)
