# I usually organize and explain my projects (case-study) as follows:

- **Introduction**
  
    The purpose of the case study is to identify and address a real-world obstacle. The scenario will be presented along with any assumptions or theories based on available information.

- **Problems** 

    The major problems will be identified and analyzed, using factual evidence to support findings.

- **Solutions**

    Possible solutions will be outlined, with consideration given to several alternatives. The pros and cons of each solution will be presented.

- **Conclusion**

    The key takeaways from the problem-solving process will be summarized in the conclusion, highlighting any lessons learned.

- **Next steps**
  
    A recommended solution will be proposed and specific actions will be outlined, including who should enforce them and when. The benefits of the recommended solution will be explained.
