# Introduction

In this case study, I will discuss how I tackled this problem by using web scraping techniques and various Python libraries to efficiently collect, process, and display the data. This is a common real-world challenge faced by many individuals and organizations when gathering data for analysis, research, or decision-making. 

# Problems

The major problem in this scenario was to extract a specific table from a Wikipedia page, save the data in a structured format like a CSV file, and then display the data in a readable table. This required analyzing the structure of the web page, identifying the relevant table, and then processing the data in a way that maintains its structure and readability.

# Solutions

To address these challenges, I devised a solution that leverages Python's beautifulsoup4, pandas, and tabulate libraries. Here's an overview of the solution:

- Use beautifulsoup4 to scrape the table data from the Wikipedia page.
- Save the extracted data in a CSV file for easy data manipulation and analysis.
- Read the data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Display the data in a formatted table using the tabulate library.

# Conclusion

Throughout this case study, I have explored the process of extracting data from a web page, storing it in a structured format, and displaying it in a visually appealing way. By leveraging Python's beautifulsoup4, pandas, and tabulate libraries, I have successfully extracted, processed, and presented the data from a Wikipedia page in a well-organized table format. This approach has proven to be efficient and adaptable for various data extraction scenarios.

# Next steps

To apply the best solution in a real-world context, I recommend the following steps:

- Choose the specific Wikipedia page or other web page from which data needs to be extracted.
- Analyze the structure of the web page and identify the relevant table or data to be extracted.
- Adjust the code to target the specific table or data on the web page if necessary.
- Execute the code to extract the data, store it in a CSV file, and display it as a formatted table.
- Review the results to ensure that the data has been extracted and displayed correctly.

By following these steps, the client or business can efficiently collect, process, and present the desired data, making it easier to analyze, understand, and make informed decisions based on the information.
