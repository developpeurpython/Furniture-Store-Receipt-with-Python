# Code explanation

- The code imports necessary libraries and modules for building and testing a machine learning model that classifies sports news articles as being about baseball or hockey.
- It fetches a dataset of sports news articles from the 20 Newsgroups corpus, splits the dataset into training and test sets, and creates a pipeline that preprocesses the data and trains a Naive Bayes classifier.
- It evaluates the performance of the model on the test set by computing its accuracy score and displays the score using Markdown.
- It uses GridSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters for the model, and outputs the best hyperparameters and their associated test score using a pandas DataFrame and Markdown.
- Finally, it provides some context and explanation for the output using Markdown.
