# Introduction

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset containing information about mobile app users to better understand their behavior, preferences, and to segment them into different groups based on their attributes. I used a dataset that can be found at this link: https://statso.io/app-users-segmentation-case-study/. My goal was to gain insights that could help improve user engagement, satisfaction, and retention. To achieve this, I explored the relationships between various variables, such as average screen time, spending on the app, and user ratings, and applied the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the users.

# Problems

The major problem I identified was understanding how users interact with the app and how their behaviors are related to their satisfaction and spending on the app. I analyzed the problem by exploring the relationships between key variables using descriptive statistics and scatter plots, as well as segmenting the users based on their characteristics using K-means clustering. The dataset provided various attributes of the users, such as average screen time, spending on the app, ratings, last visited minutes, and more.

# Solutions

After analyzing the data and creating visualizations, I propose the following solutions to better understand user behavior and improve engagement, satisfaction, and retention:

- **Investigate the relationship between average screen time and average spending on the app**: The scatter plot titled "Relationship Between Spending Capacity and Screentime" revealed a positive correlation between these variables. Users with higher screen time tend to spend more on the app. By focusing on increasing user engagement and screen time, the app may increase its revenue.

- **Examine the relationship between average screen time and user ratings**: The scatter plot titled "Relationship Between Ratings and Screentime" indicated that there might be a positive correlation between screen time and user satisfaction, as measured by ratings. This suggests that the app should focus on enhancing the user experience to increase screen time and, consequently, improve user satisfaction.

- **Segment users based on their characteristics to better target them with personalized offers, notifications, or recommendations**: The scatter plot titled "Relationship between Last Visited Minutes and Average Spending, with Segments" showed that users fall into distinct segments with different behaviors. By understanding the unique characteristics of each segment, the app can tailor its marketing and engagement strategies to better suit the needs of each group.

# Conclusion

Throughout this case study, I analyzed user behavior by exploring the relationships between key variables and segmenting users based on their characteristics. I learned that increasing user engagement and screen time can potentially improve user satisfaction and spending on the app. Additionally, segmenting users into distinct groups can help the app tailor its marketing and engagement strategies to better target each segment.

# Next Steps

I recommend that the app focuses on increasing user engagement and screen time by enhancing the user experience and offering personalized content, offers, or recommendations to different user segments. The app should also monitor user satisfaction through ratings and other feedback mechanisms. The marketing and product teams should collaborate to develop strategies that cater to the unique needs of each user segment. These initiatives should be implemented as soon as possible and monitored over time to assess their effectiveness in improving user engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
