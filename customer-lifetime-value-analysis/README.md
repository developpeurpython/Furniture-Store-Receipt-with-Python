# Introduction

In this case study, I analyze the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) across different customer acquisition channels and identify the most profitable channels for a business. CLTV is the estimated total amount a customer will spend on a business throughout their relationship with that business. By analyzing the relationship between customer acquisition costs and revenue generated, I can determine which channels are the most cost-effective for acquiring and retaining high-value customers. For this analysis, I used a dataset provided by [Statso.io](https://statso.io/customer-lifetime-value-analytics-case-study/) containing information about the customer's channel, cost of acquisition, conversion rate, and revenue generated.

# Problems

The major problems I need to address are:

- Identifying the most cost-effective channels for customer acquisition.
- Analyzing the revenue distribution across channels.
- Evaluating the conversion rates, return on investment (ROI), and CLTV for each channel.

To analyze these problems, I used Python to load, process, and visualize the data, generating several graphs and summaries to better understand the dataset.

# Solutions

To address the problems, I created visualizations to analyze the data. Below, I detail each of the 8 visualizations, explaining their purpose and insights for non-technicians:

- **Histogram of acquisition cost distribution:** This histogram displays the frequency of different acquisition costs in the dataset. Each bar represents a range of costs, and the height of the bar indicates the number of data points within that range. This visualization helps us understand the overall distribution of acquisition costs, identify patterns, and detect potential outliers.

- **Histogram of revenue distribution:** Similar to the acquisition cost histogram, this visualization displays the frequency of different revenue values in the dataset. This histogram helps us understand the overall distribution of revenues, identify patterns, and detect potential outliers, allowing for better decision-making in terms of revenue generation.

- **Bar chart of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by channel:** This bar chart shows the average acquisition cost for each channel. A lower acquisition cost per channel might indicate a more cost-effective approach. By comparing the heights of the bars, we can identify which channels have the lowest acquisition costs, allowing businesses to prioritize investments in those channels.

- **Bar chart of Conversion Rate by channel:** This chart displays the average conversion rate for each channel. Conversion rate is the percentage of customers who take a desired action, such as making a purchase. Higher conversion rates suggest better customer engagement and potential for increased revenue. Comparing the heights of the bars helps us identify the most effective channels in terms of conversion.

- **Pie chart of Total Revenue by channel:** This pie chart shows the proportion of total revenue generated by each channel. A larger slice of the pie indicates a higher revenue share, making it easier to identify which channels contribute the most to the business. This visualization helps businesses allocate resources more effectively to maximize revenue generation.

- **Bar chart of Return on Investment (ROI) by channel:** This chart shows the average ROI for each channel. ROI is calculated as the revenue generated divided by the acquisition cost. A higher ROI indicates a more profitable channel. Comparing the heights of the bars, we can identify the most profitable channels, allowing businesses to focus on strategies that yield the highest returns.

- **Bar chart of Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) by channel:** This chart displays the average CLTV for each channel. CLTV is an estimation of the total amount a customer will spend on a business throughout their relationship with that business. A higher CLTV suggests a more valuable customer base acquired through a specific channel. By comparing the heights of the bars, we can identify which channels bring the most valuable customers to the business.

- **Box plot of CLTV distribution by channel:** This box plot shows the distribution of CLTV values for each channel. The box plot displays the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data, providing a clear view of the distribution of CLTV values. This visualization helps us identify channels with the highest potential for long-term customer value, as well as detect potential outliers or unique cases that might warrant further investigation.

Each of these visualizations offers insights into different aspects of customer acquisition, revenue generation, and customer value, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies for maximum profitability.

**Pros:**

- Data-driven decision-making.
- Better understanding of channel performance.
- Ability to identify and focus on profitable channels.

**Cons:**

- Limited dataset might not capture the full picture.
- Results might not be generalizable to all businesses or industries.

# Conclusion

By analyzing the dataset, I have gained insights into the cost-effectiveness and profitability of different customer acquisition channels. This information can help businesses make informed decisions about which channels to invest in, leading to more cost-effective customer acquisition and higher overall profitability.

# Next steps

Based on my analysis, I recommend focusing on the most profitable channels identified in the visualizations. To implement this, the business should:

- Allocate more budget to the best-performing channels.
- Optimize marketing strategies for each channel based on the insights gained.
- Continuously monitor and evaluate channel performance, adjusting strategies as needed.

By taking these steps, the business can improve its customer acquisition process, leading to higher CLTV and overall profitability.
